Here's a plain language description:

The continued fractions algorithm is a method for finding the real roots of a polynomial, i.e., the values of x that make the polynomial equal to zero. The algorithm works by transforming the polynomial into simpler polynomials that have fewer sign changes in their coefficients, using two operations: Taylor shift and inversion. A Taylor shift by b is a change of variable x -> x + b, and an inversion is a change of variable x -> 1/(x + 1). The algorithm uses a lower bound on the smallest positive root of the polynomial to decide how much to shift by, and uses the Descartes’ rule of signs to determine when a polynomial has at most one positive root. The algorithm also keeps track of the intervals that contain the roots, using rational fractions to represent the endpoints. The algorithm stops when all the intervals have been output.

- This algorithm takes a polynomial and a Möbius transformation as inputs. (The Möbius transformation is a function that transforms the polynomial in a specific way, specifically it is a function of the form M(x) = \frac{ax+b}{cx+d}. See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_transformation) for more information)
- The algorithm then checks if the polynomial has any roots (values of X for which the polynomial equals zero).
  - If a root is found, it is isolated and returned. If no roots are found, the algorithm checks the number of sign changes in the polynomial.
  - If there's only one sign change, the algorithm returns the interval of the transformation.
  - If there's more than one sign change, the algorithm calculates a lower bound on the smallest positive root of the polynomial. If this lower bound is greater than or equal to 1, the polynomial and the transformation are updated.
- The algorithm then recursively calls itself with the updated polynomial and transformation until all roots are found.

Here's the pseudocode:

```pseudocode
Procedure CF(A, M)
    Input: A square-free polynomial A(X) and a Möbius transformation M(X)
    Output: A list of isolating intervals for the roots of Ain(X) in IM

    If A(0) = 0 then
        Output the interval [M(0), M(0)]
        A(X):= A(X)/X
        return CF(A, M)
    If Var(A) = 0 then return
    If Var(A) = 1 then
        Output the interval IM
        return
    b := PLB(A)
    If b ≥ 1 then
        A(X):= A(X + b)
        M(X):= M(X + b)
    AR(X):= A(1 + X)
    MR(X):= M(1 + X)
    CF(AR, MR)
    If Var(AR) < Var(A) then
        AL(X):= (1 + X)^n*A*(1/(1+X))
        ML(X):= M(1/(1+X))
        If AL(0) = 0 then AL(X):=AL(X)/X.
        CF(AL,ML)
